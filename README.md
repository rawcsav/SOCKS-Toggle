## Prerequisites

2. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x toggle_socks.sh
   ```

### Automator App

## Usage

### Script

2. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   ./toggle_socks.sh [-s <wifi_service>] [-i <proxy_ip>] [-p <proxy_port>]
   ```

   - `-s <wifi_service>`: Specify the Wi-Fi service name (default: "Wi-Fi")
   - `-i <proxy_ip>`: Specify the SOCKS proxy IP address (default: "127.0.0.1")
   - `-p <proxy_port>`: Specify the SOCKS proxy port (default: "1080")

### Automator App

## Configuration

The default configuration values are:
